### Step 1 ###

FILE : *getmeteo.html*
> This file should have a HTML form with an input text and a submit and reset button. The form should use *GET* as method to send data to the server. The input text form field should be named *location*. By now you should configure *dump.php* as the *action* to process the script.

FILE : *dump.php*
> This file should write a *dump* of the values that are received as form fiels via the *GET* and *POST* methods in PHP.
